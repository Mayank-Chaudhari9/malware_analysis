Dataset description:
======================


Data from 55,278 Android phones was collected based on modified carrot dataset. Malware samples were collected from three different sources namely Gnome, Mobile Sandbox  and McAfee.


Feature selection Technique:
============================


based on modified carrot application 4 features mainly battery usage, developer certificate, package name and version number were taken.

Overview:
=========
Researchers proposed a novel approach to directly measure the estimate of mobile malware infection rate and a light weight technique to detect susceptibility of a device to infection. They have studied the use of <dc,p,v> tuple and battery use for predicting the susceptibility of device for malware infection.  


In their study they observed the reuse of developer certificates and it was also observed that both malware and clean applications use same certificates. Based on the above mentioned features they extracted the location information by identifying the package name and currency information. This information was then used to study the malware infection over geographic regions. In addition to it they used the the energy consumption, number of installed packages and application used on an device to predict the susceptibility of device for malware infection.
