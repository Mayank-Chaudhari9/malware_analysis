Overview:
=========

Researchers has proposed a prognosis technique for detecting malware and predicting the malware infection risk of a device. Being a lightweight approach, it can be used as an elementary heuristic to filter possible malware which can be analyzed with more sophisticated tools later. The lightweight nature of MDoctor is attributed to its cloud based implementation. All the computation is offloaded to cloud and only data collection is performed on user device. The user application collects <dc,p,v> tuple and sends to the cloud application only when MDoctor application is opened and that too only if a new application is updated or installed. After data collection the cloud application performs statistical analysis of data to calculate Key trust level, Market trust level, Maliciousness  and Correlation to malware to predict the susceptibility of infection for that particular device.
